# Magnetic-Sensor

This product aims to establish security deice into the doors, which can confirm if the door is closed and can notify users if they forgot to close the door. Beyond, it can help users control the opening and closing via the magnetic lock.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implemented a magnetic sensor system with STM32 L432KC, using XBee to establish communication of data between system and server

Server source code was written by Python. System source code was written by C, with the base code of STM32CubeMX.

The main purpose of the project is to learn how to program data transfer communication with XBee and finalize a full product of an IOT system
